 # Push swap   
 --- 
 ### Description   
   
Ecole 42 common core project.   
It&#39;s about sorting numbers by using two stacks with set of rules. There are different commands:    
*ra rb rr* - rotation move first number to the end of stack (stack A, stack B, both)   
*sa sb ss* - swap first two numbers in stacks   
*rra rrb rrr* - reverse rotation the same as rotation but another way   
*pa pb* - push first number from stack to another   
   
Goals:   
- [x] **3** numbers should be sorted less than **3** steps    
- [x] **5** numbers should be sorted less than **12** steps   
- [x] **100** numbers should be sorted less than **700** steps   
- [x] **3** numbers should be sorted less than **3** steps
